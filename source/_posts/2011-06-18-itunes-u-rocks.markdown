On the side I've just started helping out on a fun iOS project.  iPhone development is one of those things that I've been meaning to do for literally 2 years now.  Finally getting that off the ground feels good.

Being one of those people who prefers instructor-lead learning over a book any day, I was thrilled to find that Stanford offers CS 193P iPhone Application Development via iTunes U for absolutely free.  They even provide the [course materials](http://cs193p.stanford.edu/) for free.

While it rained on a Saturday, I was able to "attend" the first week of classes and am busy finishing my homework.  But I had to take a break to give a shout out to Stanford and Apple for providing something so awesome.

Take a look around iTunes U and you'll definitely find something that interests you.  I remember checking it out when Apple first announced it, but it has grown very large since then.
